    <h1>MathML as a foundation</h1>
    <p>One bit of common feedback about MathML 
    is that some other form of expression is better 
    or more preferable becauase it is easier to both type
    and read than MathML which is, by comparison, 
    pretty verbose. Common examples, frequently held 
      up are ASCII-Math or TeX.
    </p>
    <p>
      People suggest, for example that <em>instead of MathML</em>, 
      what they'd like to do is write something like:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;something&gt;sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2&lt;/something&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      Or perhaps
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;something&gt;f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{2\pi i(n/T) x} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\xi_n) e^{2\pi i\xi_n x}\Delta\xi&lt;/something&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      It isn't untrue that these forms are more 
      terse and probably easier for many authors 
      to both read and type by hand.  However, 
      all of these ignore important questions 
      of how well these 'fit' into the current 
      platform and thus what would have to be 
      specified and whether that is plausible or 
      likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider that both of these take 
      a string of text which require a different 
      parser, define when that parsing happens, 
      and then finally, what to with it.  None 
      of these currently have seemingly any 
      precedent or answer, but, interestingly
      I they do have parallels. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown, for example, is similarly
      considerably easy to author, read and 
      maintain by hand than HTML itself. It 
      is more globally useful than either 
      of these, and yet, we have no <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code>
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps all of these are problems worth 
      thinking about, but there is an important 
      distinction between markdown and either 
      ASCII-Math or LaTex in that 'what to do with it'
      is relatively clear - just turn it into HTML.
      Just turning it into HTML means that it is then 
      just the platform - people can create stylesheets
      that address HTML elements, or write things 
      that progressively enhance it, and so on.
      Having a standard tree that really "fits" is
      a big advantage.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is where I think MathML helps, and 
      underscores why I think even if you don't think
      it's the best thing to write by hand, you should 
      be supporting it crossing the finish line: Because 
      it gives us precisely that, for math, and 
      it's not only almost there, but it has a rich 
      ecosystem of ways to author it or convert 
      to it (most HTML isn't written by hand either)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What this would mean is that even if you thought
      that this work belonged in the browser, 
      it's a short hop with few unknowns to something 
      very good! 
    </p>

      <h1>
        Example: ASCII Math
      </h1>
      <p>
      For example, we 
      can create a simple custom element that takes
      the first example above and allows us to 
      author
    </p>
    
    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;ascii-math&gt;sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2&lt;/ascii-math&gt;</code></pre>
    
    <p>
      which plugs into the DOM lifecycle, 
      provides it converter, uses a ShadowRoot 
      and provides us with a nice rendering...
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <ascii-math>sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2</ascii-math>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But also also a very predictable, 
      well specified tree structure, 
      about math, which fits the platform and upon
      which we could further operate/reason
    </p>

    </section>
    
    
    <section>
      <h1>
        TeX
      </h1>
      <p>
      Or, similarly, our second example we could have 
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;x-tex&gt;f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{2\pi i(n/T) x} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\xi_n) e^{2\pi i\xi_n x}\Delta\xi&lt;/x-text&gt;
</code></pre>
        
    <p>
      Which does the same and renders
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <x-tex>f(x)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{2\pi i(n/T) x} = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty \hat{f}(\xi_n) e^{2\pi i\xi_n x}\Delta\xi</x-tex>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Again, it's asking the 
      fewest questions: When it happens, how it happens, 
      what it maps to are predictable, and the final 
      answer "fits" very well into the platform and 
      authors are able to reason about it fairly well, 
      which is nice.
    </p>

      <h1>
        Final thoughts
      </h1>
      <p>
        An additionally nice thing here is that 
        having this kind of understanding about 
        common use cases for 'expanding text'
        could allow us to look at those as a 
        'class of things' and work together 
        to find ways to more generally improve 
        fundamental abilities for this 'class'
        or problem and make joint efforts 
        that increase our odds of success.
