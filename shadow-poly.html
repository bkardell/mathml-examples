    <h1>Polyfilling MathML beyond MathML-Core with Shadow DOM: An Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      The efforts to move MathML forward are based around 
      an analysis of what is both implmented and used and 
      extracting this to defining a minimal viable 
      subset to be natively supported by browsers.
      This new subset is being defined as <a href="https://mathml-refresh.github.io/mathml-core/">MathML Core</a>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      MathML Core is a substantial pruning of just what 
      is really necessary.  If you want more than that, 
      this is left to polyfills.  Traditionally, 
      though, math polyfills have been a little harder 
      than they should be, with some not-so-desireable
      side effects of being destructive, lacking live-ness
      and just generally present mental model mismatch 
      problems.  They hamper an author's ability 
      to actually reason about the DOM tree that they wrote.  
      MathML elements lacking important common platform APIs 
      which made them very 'different'.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the things that we are doing in spec'ing out MathML Core 
      is connecting the missing platform APIs and making MathML elements
      more similar.  One of the ideas we had was to follow through 
      with some other ideas happening in chromium right now and simply 
      allow any unknown MathML element to have a Shadow DOM.
    </p>
      
      <section>
        <h1>
          example
        </h1>
        
        <p>
          MathML Core, for example does not support <code>mfenced</code>
          because it is, effectively, a shorthand which is strictly 
          equivalent for something else.  It is mostly useful if you 
          are coding MathML by hand, which is far rarer than creating 
          it via tools. 
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
          So, given some code like this...
        </p>
        
        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;math&gt; 
  &lt;mfenced&gt;
    &lt;mi&gt;x&lt;/mi&gt; 
  &lt;/mfenced&gt;
&lt;/math&gt;</code></pre>
         

      <p>
        With this in place, and a polyfill for <code>&lt;mfenced&gt;</code>
        we wind up with a tree that looks like this
      </p>

        <figcaption>devtools illustrating the same light DOM, but a shadow root containing expanded 
          elements

      <p>
        If you're interested, you 
        can <a href="https://build-chromium.igalia.com/mathml/packages/">download an experimental build for linux</a>
        created by my team at Igalia and 
        head over and 
        <a href="fenced.html">view some <code>&lt;mfenced&gt;</code> examples yourself</a>
        which are module based and live-DOM attached.
      </p>
